本附录规定了被称为PLC-G3-MIB的MIB的一部分，该部分用于管理OFDM G3 PLC接口的PHY和MAC级别

## 11.1 RELATION WITH THE INTERFACES MIB
The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] requires that all the MIBs that are added to it clarify certain points that are intentionally left vague in its definition. The following table provides the clarifications necessary for the case of the OFDM G3 PLC interface.  
接口MIB [RFC2863]要求添加到它的所有MIB澄清在其定义中有意留下模糊的某些点。 下表提供了OFDM G3 PLC接口情况下所需的说明。
