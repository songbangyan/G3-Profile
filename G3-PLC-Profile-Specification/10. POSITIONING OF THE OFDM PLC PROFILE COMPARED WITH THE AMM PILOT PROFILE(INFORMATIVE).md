# 10 POSITIONING OF THE OFDM PLC PROFILE COMPARED WITH THE AMM PILOT PROFILE

## 10.1 BENEFITS BROUGHT BY THE OFDM PLC PROFILE
 * Data rates  
 The OFDM PLC profile brings a clear advantage in terms of data rates, since the net data rate, after deducting the overheads introduced by the coding, is about 30 kb/s for DQPSK modulation, 15 kb/for DBPSK modulation and 3500 b/s for ROBO modulation, whereas the SFSK modulation used by the AMM pilot profile has raw data rates of 2400 b/s and 1200b/s.  
 OFDM PLC配置文件在数据速率方面带来明显的优势，因为在减去由编码引入的开销后，净数据速率对于DQPSK调制为约30kb/s，对于DBPSK调制为15kb/s，对于ROBO调制约3500b/s，而由AMM导频简档使用的SFSK调制具有2400b/s和1200b/s的原始数据速率。  
 Furthermore, the OFDM PLC profile has several mechanisms that enable maximum benefit to be drawn from the CENELEC A band at all times:  
 此外，OFDM PLC简档具有几个机制，使得能够始终从CENELEC A频带获得最大的好处：  
   * Configuration frequency masking in order to avoid disturbing other systems operating in the same frequency band  
   配置频率掩蔽，以避免干扰在相同频带中操作的其他系统  
   * Unidirectional channel estimation in order to apply the most suitable modulation  scheme between two neighbouring nodes  
   单向信道估计，以便在两个相邻节点之间应用最合适的调制方案  
   * Mesh routing protocol capable of determining the optimum path between two remote nodes of the network  
   网状路由协议，能够确定网络的两个远程节点之间的最佳路径  

 * Same metering applications (COSEM)  
 The two profiles implement the same COSEM Application suites (IEC 62056-53], [IEC 62056-61] and [IEC 62056-62]) in order to give the operator a uniform picture of the information specific to the metering activity.  
 这两个配置文件实现了相同的COSEM应用程序套件（IEC 62056-53），[IEC 62056-61]和[IEC 62056-62]），以便向操作员提供计量活动特定信息的统一图片。

 * MAC level Security  
 Within a global Security policy, the introduction of MAC level Security services is the necessary complement to the mechanisms operating at the COSEM Application level.  
 在全球安全政策中，引入MAC级安全服务是对在COSEM应用层运行的机制的必要补充。  
 These MAC level services are based on known, tried and tested schemes. They are nevertheless simple, since they are based on a unique proof of identity (a 128-bit shared secret) and a single cryptographic algorithm (AES-128).  
 这些MAC级服务基于已知，试验和测试的方案。 然而，它们是简单的，因为它们基于唯一的身份证明（128位共享秘密）和单个加密算法（AES-128）。  
 They propose a strong Authentication and CCM* encryption which brings Confidentiality and Integrity. An Anti-Replay mechanism is also provided.  
 他们提出了一个强大的认证和CCM* 加密，带来了保密性和完整性。 还提供了错误自修正机制。

 * Architecture diversity and openness (IP)  
 The introduction of technologies from the world of the Internet into the OFDM PLC profile (IPv6 in this case, to guarantee the long-term continuity) opens up new possibilities in the architecture of the networks.  
 将来自互联网世界的技术引入OFDM PLC简档（在这种情况下为IPv6，以保证长期连续性）在网络的架构中开辟了新的可能性。  
 Thus the AMM pilot profile in practice leads to the Concentrator being designed like a poorly transparent Application relay and the application intelligence to be distributed between the Central Information System, the Concentrator and the Meter.  
 因此，AMM导频简档实际上导致集中器被设计为像一个透明性差的应用中继和应用智能，以在中央信息系统，集中器和仪表之间分配。  
 Without necessarily calling into question the concept, the OFDM PLC profile allows it to evolve. It thus becomes possible to put the Meter and the Information System in direct contact for certain functions such as Equipment Management, software downloading or Security.  
 在不必质疑概念的情况下，OFDM PLC简档允许其演进。 因此，可以使仪表和信息系统直接接触某些功能，例如设备管理，软件下载或安全。

 * Open Equipment Management (SNMP)  
 The opening up to the technologies of the Internet world enables the metering domain to benefit from new tools such as Equipment Management by SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), which reduces the acquisition and operating costs, as is witnessed by its widespread adoption by Network operators.  
 开放互联网世界的技术使得计量领域能够受益于诸如SNMP（简单网络管理协议）的设备管理等新工具，这减少了获取和操作成本，这已经被网络运营商广泛采用 。  
 But other schemes even better suited to the management of millions of terminal equipment items are reaching maturity, such as those based on the CWMP protocol of the BroadBand Forum (better known under the reference TR-069). Here they are based on very widely distributed Web technologies and are associated with a vast number of tools. The majority of them exists as freeware and is therefore free of charge.  
 但是其他更适合管理数百万终端设备项目的方案正在达到成熟，例如基于BroadBand论坛（在参考文献TR-069中更好地知道）的CWMP协议的方案。 这里他们基于非常广泛分布的Web技术，并与大量的工具相关联。 其中大多数是免费软件，因此是免费的。  

 * Software (Firmware) management (TFTP)  
 Another example of the benefits brought by the introduction of Internet technologies is the use of standard protocols and tools for the downloading and management of firmware.  
 引入因特网技术带来的好处的另一个例子是使用标准协议和工具来下载和管理固件。  
 This is an essential point since it guarantees the scalability and long-term continuity of the solution and the related equipment.  
 这是一个关键点，因为它保证了解决方案和相关设备的可扩展性和长期连续性。  

## 10.2 COHABITATION OF THE TWO PROFILES AND EVOLUTION SCENARIO
At the Physical level, the frequency masking possibilities provided by the OFDM PLC profile allow sharing of the CENELEC A band, and sharing of the PLC infrastructure over and beyond this.  
在物理层，由OFDM PLC简档提供的频率掩蔽可能性允许共享CENELEC A频带，并且共享PLC基础设施超过这一点。  
Thus, meters coming from the two profiles can be made to cohabit in a given sector.  
因此，来自两个轮廓的仪表可以在给定的扇区中共同驻留。  
At Application level, the reference to the same standards enables the view of the Metering activity information provided to the Operator to be rendered uniform.  
在应用级别，对相同标准的引用使得提供给运营商的计量活动信息的视图统一。  
On the Concentrator side one can:  
在集中器侧可以：  
 * Either juxtapose two concentrators that each treat their pool of meters and feed back the information independently to one and the same Information System.  
 或者并列两个集中器，每个集中器处理他们的计量器池并且将信息独立地反馈到同一个信息系统。
 * Or design a mixed concentrator that embeds the equipment necessary for the implementation of the PHY and MAC levels in the two technologies and the PLC communication profile up to the COSEM Application Layer.   
 或者设计一个混合集中器，将嵌入在两种技术和PLC通信配置文件中实现PHY和MAC级所必需的设备直到COSEM应用层。  

In both cases, the pooling of elements other than Applications (e.g. the pooling of the LLC layer:IEC 61334-4-32) would not bring any decisive advantage and would slow down the evolution of the solution. This is why it has not been taken up again in the present specification.  
在这两种情况下，应用程序以外的元素（例如LLC层的合并：IEC 61334-4-32）的汇集不会带来任何决定性的优点，并且会减慢解决方案的演进。 这就是为什么它在本说明书中没有被再次采用的原因。
